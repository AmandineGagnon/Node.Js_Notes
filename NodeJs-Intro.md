# Node.js

## Why using Node.js

* Highly scalable, data-intensive, and real time apps. 
* Superfast and highly scalable.
* JavaScript Everywhere (on Front-End and Back-End).
* Large ecosystem of open-source libs. 
* Used by: Uber, Paypal, Walt-Mart, etc. 
* Node.js is not a FrameWork it is a runtime environment for executing JS. 
* Node.js is a runtime environment executing JavaScript in the backend. It gives us more features and capabilities that engine that runs JavaScript in the browser (Chrome, Edge, Mozilla). 
* Node.Js is asynchronous architecture. A single thread can be used to serve different requests at the same time. Think of a waiter in a restaurant that is waiting for the cook the prepare the meal before taking the order in another table.
* Do not use Node for CPU-Intensive apps. Only used it for data intensive and real time application. 
* Node.js works in module. Every file of a project is a module. Every function that we define is a module is accessible only in that module.
* Node.Js is build on Chrome v8 JS engine
